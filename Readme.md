(WIP)

This project is an ongoing project to create .NET 6 bindings for the [GPAC project](https://github.com/gpac/gpac)

The objectives are to support:

* building complete GPAC processing pipelines using C#/.NET
* creating fitlers with C#/.NET
* outputing to .NET MAUI

For now, only Windows is supported, Linux and MacOS are expected soon.

Although I am member of the GPAC project on Github, this project is a personal initiative and is not endorsed by the GPAC team. Do not seek support on their channels.

To run it:

* first install the latest version of GPAC found [here](https://gpac.wp.imt.fr/downloads/gpac-nightly-builds/)
* clone
* dotnet test
